Project description
===================
This program will modelling the Ecosystem of an island called Rossumøya.
In this island we can find certain amount of herbivores and carnivores.
The landscape types on Rossumøya is lowland, highland, desert and Water.

The simulation has the goal of stimulating the population of herbivores
and carnivores and showing their behavior in the island according to their characteristics.


Achievement
===========
In this project, we have managed to create a structured plan with our own deadlines and goals and
have manged to follow up on it.

Our main goal was to include everything the task asks for and make the simulation work. It's a goal
that we believe we have managed to achieve during this block period and something we are very proud of. This
script of this project can now be used by of The Environmental Protection Agency of Pylandia (EPAP).

We have enjoyed very much with this project and had a lot of 'aha' moments while programing the simulation.
This project has helped us with increase our collaboration skills and out knowledge to use Agile development techniques.
This project have helped us develop our programming skills and made us better programmers, than what we were
before this project. It has been a project that has helped us to develop our skills to work faster, take the
right decision and do things right.

We can guarantee that this is a project that has learned us a lot of new things and something we will definitely take
with us and will need in the future.

Some improvements we can make
=============================
* Create more test for more coverage
* Better visualization plot
* Add some extra fixtures
