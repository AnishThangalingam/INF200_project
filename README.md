### Project in INF200 January block 2021

#### Authors: Majorann Thevarajah & Anish Thangalingam

#### Project description
This program will modelling the Ecosystem of an island called Rossumøya.
In this island we can find certain amount of herbivores and carnivores.

#### Achievement
In this project, we have maneged to create a structured plan with our own deadlines and goals and
have manged to follow up on it. 

Our main goal was to include everything the task asks for and make the simulation work. It's a goal 
that we believe we have manged to achieve during this block period and something we are very proud of.

We have enjoyed very much with this project and had a lot of 'aha' moments while programing the simulation.
This project has helped us with increase our collaboration skills and out knowledge to use Agile development techniques.
It has been a project that has helped us to develp our skills to work faster, take the right decision and
do things right. 

We can guarantee that this is a project that has learned us a lot of new things and something we will definitely take 
with us and will need in the future.
